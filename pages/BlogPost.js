              They have reminded drivers that the extreme heat can affect their
              ability to drive safely and that taking precautions can prevent

              safety during hot weather. These precautions include wearing lightweight

          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              San Francisco is known for its cool, foggy weather, but in recent years,
              the city has experienced occasional heatwaves. These heatwaves can be dangerous,
              especially for truck drivers who spend long hours on the road. The scorching
              sun can cause fatigue, dehydration, and heat exhaustion, which can impair a
              driver's ability to operate their vehicle safely. As a result, the city of
              San Francisco has issued a warning to truck drivers to take caution during
              hot weather. <br />
              The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) has advised truck
              drivers to be aware of the risks associated with driving in hot weather and
              to take precautions to ensure their safety. The agency has recommended that
              drivers wear lightweight, breathable clothing, and drink plenty of water to
              stay hydrated. They have also advised drivers to take frequent breaks to rest
              and cool down, especially during the hottest part of the day.
              In addition to these general precautions, the SFMTA has also recommended that
              truck drivers take specific measures to prevent heat-related illnesses. For
              example, they have advised drivers to park in shaded areas whenever possible
              and to avoid leaving their vehicles in direct sunlight. They have also
              recommended that drivers use sunshades to block out the sun's rays and keep
              the interior of their vehicles cool.
